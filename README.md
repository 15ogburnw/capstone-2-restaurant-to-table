This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and originally bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It has a full authentication service and serverless Postgres database-integrated backend via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

This Project is a current work in progress and there are a large number of features and pages that are either incompletely styled, not fully implemented or both. The authentication is complete and the recipe search function is 80% to completion. The current active preview deployment can be viewed at https://rtt-nextjs.vercel.app/
